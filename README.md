# Devin-Nguyen-s-Portfolio

The following is my portfolio meant to be viewd by future employers. It includes so of my past projects and also has palceholders for me future projects! I will be constantly updating this profile as I make more and more projects.

## Prerequisites and Installations

This is a simple application and just requires a web browser. To use the application, simply clicked on the different tags in the navigation bar and the UI will autonmatically scroll to the section. Clicking on the pictures of my projects will also take you to the deployed website of that application.

## Acceptance Criteria
* A sample of a potential employee's work when the website is loaded
* A name, recent photo, and links to sections about work and contact info 
* Navigation for previously mentioned links that has the UI scroll to the section when the word is clicked in the nav bar
* Sections with my work where the first item is larger than the others
* When the user clicks on the work samples they are redirected to the deployed application
* The page is optimized to fit different screen sizes and devices
